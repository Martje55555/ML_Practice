## Support Vector Machine
SVM (Support vector machine) is an efficient classification method when the feature vector is high dimensional. In sci-kit learn, we can specify the kernel function (here, linear). 

#### What is `high dimensionial data`?

With high dimensional data, the number of features can exceed the number of observations. For example, microarrays, which measure gene expression, can contain tens of hundreds of samples.
