## Decision Tree
 A decision tree classifier is a systematic approach for multiclass classification. It poses a set of questions to the dataset (related to its attributes/features). The decision tree classification algorithm can be visualized on a binary tree. On the root and each of the internal nodes, a question is posed and the data on that node is further split into separate records that have different characteristics. The leaves of the tree refer to the classes in which the dataset is split. 
 
 This folder contains examples with both binary (0, 1) and multi-class (0, 1, 2, 3..) targets.
