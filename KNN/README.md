## K-Nearest Neighbors

This classification algorithm does not depend on the structure of the data. Whenever a new example is encountered, its k nearest neighbors from the training data are examined. Distance between two examples can be the euclidean distance between their feature vectors. The majority class among the k nearest neighbors is taken to be the class for the encountered example.
